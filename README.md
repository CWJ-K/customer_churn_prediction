# Customer Churn Prediction

Telecommunication industry is a battlefield to compete for customers, especially for existing ones. That is why customer churn is a hot topic for companies and various methodologies are used to help companies stay competitive. This paper presents customer churn prediction on large Southeast Asia Telecommunication Company. Five prediction techniques, Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest, are used to identify churners and explore their features. After that, we have conducted comparative tests to evaluate the five models and Random Forest produces better results. Therefore, Random Forest is used in our final test data prediction.

The report also finds some important features from Lasso Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Those variables have high impact on churn. Hence, we suggest the company to focus on them and further in the paper recommendations are provided.
